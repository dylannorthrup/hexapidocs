Documentation on the Hex API

## What is the "Hex API"?
The Hex TCG (available at http://www.hextcg.com/) is a digital Trading Card Game.  One of the features it has is an
API that provides data about the game while it's played.

## So I can modify the API here?
Nope. This just tells you how to use the data it generates.

## What if I know all this and want to tell you you're wrong about something on here?
Awesome.  Issue a pull request and we'll take a look at it.  If you're right, we'll merge it in and make the 
docuemntation here more awesome!

## How is this information organized?
Poorly.  Or, rather, it's the first thing that came to mind when setting this up. If you've got a better idea, 
we're open to suggestions for improvement ("Pull requests welcome" as they say).

## Where is the information?
Right now it's in separate files.  The different files cover setup of the API file, different API messages 
(including examples), and a list of some tools that take advantage of the API information.  More files may be created
if necessary.

## Who helped out with this?
The main helper is Chris Woods who programmed the API in the first place.  A lot of the initial information 
is taken from various posters on the Hex Forums, specifically the Hex API thread ( http://forums.cryptozoic.com/showthread.php?t=40975 ).  Most of the information here is simply repackaging and updating that information.

## So, where are those files?
